# Multicategory-classification

## Context

The idea of this project is to classify 3 groups of 2-dimension data (x,y) linearly separables with a multi-output perceptron.

## Objective

Build a neural network capable to classify 3 groups of data.

## Results

A 2-3 neural network was built. After 20 epochs and a learning rate of 0.1 the equations of the three boundaries are:

   f1(x) = 3.45x -1.33
   
   f2(x) = -1.56x + 2.59
   
   f3(x) = 0.16x + 0.1
